description:
  This package provides a data type @These a b@ which can hold a value of either
  type or values of each type. This is usually thought of as an "inclusive or"
  type (contrasting @Either a b@ as "exclusive or") or as an "outer join" type
  (contrasting @(a, b)@ as "inner join").
  .
  @
  data These a b = This a | That b | These a b
  @
  .
  Since version 1, this package was split into parts:
  .
  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semialign semialign> For @Align@ and @Zip@ type-classes.
  .
  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semialign-indexed semialign-indexed> For @SemialignWithIndex@ class, providing @ialignWith@ and @izipWith@.
  .
  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/these-lens these-lens> For lens combinators.
  .
  * <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-chronicle monad-chronicle> For transformers variant of @These@.
