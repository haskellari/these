-- | The 'These' type represents values with two non-exclusive possibilities.
--
--   This can be useful to represent combinations of two values, where the 
--   combination is defined if either input is. Algebraically, the type 
--   @These A B@ represents @(A + B + AB)@, which doesn't factor easily into
--   sums and products--a type like @Either A (B, Maybe A)@ is unclear and
--   awkward to use.
--
--   'These' has straightforward instances of 'Functor', 'Monad', &c., and 
--   behaves like a hybrid error/writer monad, as would be expected.
