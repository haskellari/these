-- | The 'These' type represents values with two non-exclusive possibilities.
--
--   This can be useful to represent combinations of two values, where the
--   combination is defined if either input is. Algebraically, the type
--   @'These' A B@ represents @(A + B + AB)@, which doesn't factor easily into
--   sums and products--a type like @'Either' A (B, 'Maybe' A)@ is unclear and
--   awkward to use.
--
--   'These' has straightforward instances of 'Functor', 'Monad', &c., and
--   behaves like a hybrid error/writer monad, as would be expected.
--
--   For zipping and unzipping of structures with 'These' values, see
--   "Data.Align".
